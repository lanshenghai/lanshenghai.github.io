A webpage for the simple static page for github.io: [https://pages.github.com/]

Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll [https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/]

Please remember the page should be in `master` branch, not in `gh-pages`.

Note: for gem, you should replace it with taobao (it's more fast!)

```
gem sources --add https://ruby.taobao.org/ --remove https://rubygems.org/
```
